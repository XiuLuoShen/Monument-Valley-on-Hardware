ECE241 Final Project

We created an interactive game modelled off of the popular iOS game Monument Valley. Monument Valley uses isometric graphics and tricks in perspective to create a puzzle environment that a user can explore. Based on these concepts, we knew that we could implement a similar game using the VGA and a keyboard for user controls, learning how to build this custom game using hardware.
